# Overview

Created a funny tic tac toe game to experiment with Pygame and python coding. X is represented as a raccoon and O is represented as an Opossum. (meant to be funny but functioning to practice logic and programming with the gaming tools)

Tic tac toe standart rules, x goes first, take turns and try to get three in a row verticle, horizontal, or diagnal.
